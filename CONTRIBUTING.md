## Contributing

In general, we'll follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the project to your own account/machine
3. Work on your fork
    1. Make your changes and additions
    2. Add changes to README.md if needed
4. Commit changes to your own branch
5. **Make sure** you merge the latest from "upstream" and resolve conflicts if there is any
6. Push your work back up to your fork
7. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
